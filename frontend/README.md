### Plan

Chatbot needs to be reworked to be usable as a UI ChatBot

- I need to allow streaming output
- User message gets taken - creates a chat element - then gets send away and the backend response needs then to be passed to the chatbot. 
-> it must be possible to create conversation stack at runtime
